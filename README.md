# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
We have been tasked with creating visualizations of rideshare data from January, 2019 to the beginning of May of the same year. The goal is to provide insight on how to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. We will compare figures of rides, number of drivers, and total fares, between the three types of cities.


## Results
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""


As a high level overview, we found that the total combined average fare for the months January through the end of April for the three different types of cities as follows:
- Rural cities: $230
- Suburban cities: $1041
- Urban cities: $2161


Suburban city fares are about 4.5 times higher than rural, and urban cities are over 9 times higher. Our findings are summarized below
